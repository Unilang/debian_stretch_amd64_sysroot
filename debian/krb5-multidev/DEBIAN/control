Description: development files for MIT Kerberos without Heimdal conflict
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").
 .
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5.
 .
 Most users wishing to build applications against MIT Kerberos should
 install libkrb5-dev.  However, that package conflicts with heimdal-dev.
 This package installs libraries and headers in /usr/include/mit-krb5 and
 /usr/lib/mit-krb5 and can be installed along side heimdal-multidev, which
 provides the same facilities for Heimdal.
